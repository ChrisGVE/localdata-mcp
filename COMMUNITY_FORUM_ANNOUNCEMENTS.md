While working on MCP integrations for production systems, I consistently ran into issues with existing database connectivity options:
- Limited database type support
- Insufficient security controls for production deployment
- Poor handling of large datasets and files
- Fragmented solutions requiring multiple servers

**LocalData MCP's Approach:**

**🎯 Universal Connectivity**
One server handles: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB + structured files (CSV, JSON, YAML, TOML). No need for multiple specialized servers.

**🛡️ Security-First Architecture**
- Path security using `Path.resolve()` + `relative_to()` validation
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries and `quoted_name()`
- Connection semaphore limiting (max 10 concurrent)
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

**⚡ Performance & Scale**
- Files >100MB automatically use temporary SQLite for memory efficiency
- Query buffering system for results >100 rows with intelligent chunking
- Thread-safe design using locks and semaphores
- Auto-cleanup mechanisms with file modification detection

**📊 Real-World Testing**
- 100+ test cases covering security vulnerabilities, performance edge cases, and concurrent access
- Tested with 1GB+ files and massive query result sets
- Production deployment validation

**API Design Philosophy:**
- 100% backward compatibility (all existing tool signatures unchanged)
- Enhanced responses with additional metadata
- New buffering tools available when needed
- Consistent error handling and messaging

**Installation & Quick Start:**
```bash
pip install localdata-mcp
```

**MCP Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "localdata": {
      "command": "localdata-mcp",
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Code Example:**
```python
# Universal database connectivity
connect_database("analytics", "postgresql", "postgresql://localhost/data")
connect_database("config", "yaml", "./settings.yaml")
connect_database("logs", "json", "./application_logs.json")

# Consistent querying across all sources
data = execute_query("analytics", "SELECT * FROM user_events WHERE date >= '2024-01-01'")
settings = read_text_file("./settings.yaml", "yaml")
```

**Technical Architecture Highlights:**
- **Thread Safety**: Semaphores for connection limiting, locks for shared state
- **Memory Management**: Streaming processing with constant memory usage
- **Security**: Multiple layers of input validation and sanitization
- **Scalability**: Intelligent switching between in-memory and file-based processing
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed, actionable messages

**What I'd Love Feedback On:**
1. **API Design**: Does the tool interface feel intuitive for MCP workflows?
2. **Security Model**: Are there additional security considerations I should address?
3. **Performance**: Any specific performance scenarios you'd like me to test?
4. **Feature Gaps**: What database-related functionality is missing from the MCP ecosystem?

**Contributing:**
The project is MIT licensed and actively seeking contributors. Areas where help would be appreciated:
- Additional database driver support
