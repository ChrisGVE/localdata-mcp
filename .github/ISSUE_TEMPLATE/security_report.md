## Security Report

**IMPORTANT**: For critical security vulnerabilities, please email privately to **christian@berclaz.org** instead of creating a public issue.

## Vulnerability Type

Select the type of security issue:

- [ ] Path traversal vulnerability
- [ ] SQL injection vulnerability  
- [ ] Authentication bypass
- [ ] Authorization bypass
- [ ] Information disclosure
- [ ] Remote code execution
- [ ] Denial of service
- [ ] Input validation bypass
- [ ] Connection/resource exhaustion
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Severity Assessment

**Self-assessed severity level**:

- [ ] **Critical** - Remote code execution, data breach, complete system compromise
- [ ] **High** - Privilege escalation, significant data access, bypass security controls
- [ ] **Medium** - Information disclosure, limited access, moderate impact
- [ ] **Low** - Minor information disclosure, low impact

## Vulnerability Details

**Affected Component(s)**:
- [ ] Path containment (which files the server may read and write)
- [ ] SQL execution (`query`) — including anything that writes through it
- [ ] The read-only posture, or the per-attach `writable` grant
- [ ] Attaching a datasource (`attach`, `add_table`)
- [ ] Writing files out (`save`, `query` with a `path`)
- [ ] File handling (CSV, TSV, SQLite)
- [ ] Slot lifecycle and eviction
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Detailed Description**:
A clear description of the security vulnerability. Include technical details but avoid full exploitation code if the issue is critical.

## Steps to Reproduce

Provide minimal steps to demonstrate the vulnerability:

1. Setup: `attach(...)`
2. Action: `query(...)`, or whichever verb is involved
3. Observe: [security issue manifests]

**Test Environment**:
- LocalData MCP Version: [e.g., v1.0.0]
- Python Version: [e.g., 3.9.7]
- Operating System: [e.g., macOS, Linux, Windows]
- Database Type: [e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite]

## Evidence

If applicable, provide:

- Log outputs (sanitize sensitive information)
- Screenshots demonstrating the issue
- Proof-of-concept code (if low/medium severity)

## Impact Assessment

**What can an attacker achieve?**
- [ ] Read arbitrary files from the filesystem
- [ ] Write files outside allowed directories
- [ ] Execute arbitrary SQL commands
- [ ] Access unauthorized databases
- [ ] Cause denial of service
- [ ] Bypass connection limits
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Prerequisites for exploitation**:
- [ ] No special access required
- [ ] Local file system access required
- [ ] Database connection required
- [ ] Specific database configuration required
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Affected Versions

Which versions are affected?
- [ ] Current main branch
- [ ] v1.0.0
- [ ] All versions
- [ ] Specific version: ___________

## Potential Mitigations

**Immediate Workarounds** (if known):
- Avoid using specific features
- Additional input validation
- Configuration changes
- Other: ___________

**Suggested Fix Approach**:
Brief, high-level suggestions for addressing the vulnerability.
