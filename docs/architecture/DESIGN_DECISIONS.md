# LocalData MCP v2.0 - Design Decision Framework

## Overview

This document provides a systematic framework for making architectural decisions that align with our [First Principles](./FIRST_PRINCIPLES.md). Every design choice should be evaluated through this lens to ensure consistency with our core architectural philosophy.

## Decision Evaluation Framework

### The Five Core Tests

Every design decision must pass these fundamental tests:

#### 1. LLM Naturalness Test
**Question**: "Would an LLM agent naturally use this API?"

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Does the interface match how LLMs naturally express analytical intentions?
- Can an LLM discover and use this tool through conversation?
- Are parameters expressed in semantic terms rather than technical jargon?
- Does the tool respond appropriately to varied expression of the same intent?

**Pass Examples**:
```
analyze_outliers(data, sensitivity="moderate")  # Semantic parameter
explore_correlations(data, focus="business_variables")  # Intent-driven
```

**Fail Examples**:
```
detect_outliers(data, z_threshold=2.5, iqr_multiplier=1.5)  # Too technical
correlation_matrix(data, method="pearson", alpha=0.05)  # Parameter-heavy
```

#### 2. Composition Test
**Question**: "Does this result feed naturally into other tools?"

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Are results structured for downstream consumption?
- Does the output include metadata for automatic parameter inference?
- Can results be chained without manual data transformation?
- Do results preserve context for subsequent analysis steps?

**Pass Examples**:
```
{
  "primary_result": {...},
  "metadata": {
    "data_characteristics": {...},
    "suggested_next_steps": [...],
    "composition_hooks": {...}
  },
  "context": {...}
}
```

**Fail Examples**:
```
# Raw results with no composition metadata
[0.85, 0.92, 0.76, ...]

# Results requiring manual transformation
{"correlation_coefficient": 0.85}  # No context for next steps
```

#### 3. Streaming Compatibility Test
**Question**: "Can this work with chunked/streaming data?"

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Does the algorithm support incremental processing?
- Are memory requirements bounded regardless of dataset size?
- Can the tool provide partial results during processing?
- Is there graceful degradation for memory-constrained scenarios?

**Pass Examples**:
```
# Incremental correlation calculation
for chunk in data_stream:
    correlation_state.update(chunk)
    if correlation_state.ready():
        yield correlation_state.get_partial_result()
```

**Fail Examples**:
```
# Requires entire dataset in memory
correlation_matrix = np.corrcoef(full_dataset.T)
```

#### 4. Progressive Complexity Test
**Question**: "Can this be simple for basic use, detailed for advanced use?"

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Does the tool work with minimal configuration?
- Are advanced parameters available but not required?
- Does the system make intelligent defaults based on data characteristics?
- Can complexity be added incrementally rather than all-or-nothing?

**Pass Examples**:
```
# Simple call with intelligent defaults
detect_patterns(data)

# Progressive complexity
detect_patterns(data, types=["seasonal", "trend"])
detect_patterns(data, types=["seasonal"], seasonal_method="additive", confidence=0.95)
```

#### 5. Domain Integration Test
**Question**: "Does this fit naturally with other data science domains?"

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Can this tool's results inform other domains' analyses?
- Does the tool accept context from other domains?
- Are interfaces consistent with other domain tools?
- Does the tool contribute to cross-domain workflows?

**Pass Examples**:
```
# Time series results informing regression
ts_insights = analyze_time_series(data)
regression_model = build_model(data, temporal_context=ts_insights)
```

### Trade-off Resolution Process

When tests conflict, use this hierarchy to resolve trade-offs:

#### Priority 1: LLM Experience
If a choice significantly improves LLM-agent interaction, it trumps other concerns.
- **Example**: Choose semantic parameters over performance optimizations
- **Rationale**: Our primary users are LLM agents, not human statisticians

#### Priority 2: Composition & Workflow
Cross-tool composition is more valuable than individual tool optimization.
- **Example**: Standardized result formats over domain-specific outputs
- **Rationale**: Most valuable analyses involve multiple tools

#### Priority 3: Memory Constraints
Memory bounds are hard constraints that cannot be violated.
- **Example**: Streaming algorithms over exact batch algorithms
- **Rationale**: System stability and predictability are non-negotiable

#### Priority 4: Simplicity
Default simplicity over comprehensive configuration.
- **Example**: Smart defaults over exhaustive parameter exposure
- **Rationale**: Most use cases should be simple, complexity should be opt-in

#### Priority 5: Performance
Optimize performance within the constraints of higher priorities.
- **Example**: Efficient algorithms within streaming constraints
- **Rationale**: Performance matters, but not at the cost of core principles

## Common Decision Patterns

### Interface Design Patterns

#### Pattern: Semantic Parameter Names
```
# Good: Semantic meaning clear to LLMs
strength="strong", sensitivity="high", focus="recent_data"

# Avoid: Technical parameters requiring domain knowledge  
threshold=0.85, alpha=0.05, window_size=30
```

#### Pattern: Intent-Based Tool Names
```
# Good: Describes analytical intention
explore_relationships(), detect_anomalies(), model_trends()

# Avoid: Implementation-focused names
pearson_correlation(), z_score_outliers(), arima_forecast()
```

#### Pattern: Contextual Defaults
```python
def analyze_data(data, context=None):
    # Use context to inform defaults
    if context and context.data_type == "time_series":
        default_methods = ["trend", "seasonality", "outliers"]
    elif context and context.data_type == "categorical":
        default_methods = ["distribution", "associations"]
    else:
        default_methods = ["profile", "correlations"]
```

### Result Structure Patterns

#### Pattern: Enriched Results
```python
{
    "primary_result": {
        # Main analysis results
    },
    "metadata": {
        "data_characteristics": {...},
        "method_used": "...",
        "confidence": "...",
        "suggestions": {
            "next_steps": [...],
            "related_analyses": [...],
            "warnings": [...]
        }
    },
    "composition_hooks": {
        "for_regression": {...},
        "for_clustering": {...},
        "for_visualization": {...}
    },
    "interpretation": {
        "summary": "Natural language summary",
        "key_insights": [...],
        "business_implications": [...]
    }
}
```

### Algorithm Selection Patterns

#### Pattern: Adaptive Processing Strategy
```python
def select_algorithm(data, memory_budget, accuracy_requirements):
    data_size = estimate_memory_usage(data)
    
    if data_size < memory_budget * 0.5:
        return exact_algorithm
    elif data_size < memory_budget * 0.8:
        return approximate_algorithm  
    else:
        return streaming_algorithm
```

#### Pattern: Graceful Degradation
```python
def analyze_with_degradation(data, target_accuracy=0.95):
    try:
        return high_accuracy_analysis(data)
    except MemoryError:
        return medium_accuracy_analysis(data.sample(0.8))
    except MemoryError:
        return basic_analysis(data.sample(0.5))
```

- [ ] Domain Integration: [result]

**Implications**: How this affects other components

**Review Date**: When to revisit this decision
```

### Decision Archive
Maintain a decision log in `/docs/architecture/decisions/` for major choices:
- `001-interface-design-philosophy.md`
- `002-memory-management-strategy.md`
- `003-library-wrapping-approach.md`

## Evolution Guidelines

### When to Revisit Principles
- **New LLM interaction patterns emerge**: e.g., multi-modal agents, code-generating agents
- **Performance constraints change**: e.g., memory becomes cheaper, streaming requirements change
- **Usage patterns differ from assumptions**: e.g., most workflows are single-tool rather than multi-tool

### Decision Review Process
1. **Quarterly**: Review recent decisions for consistency and effectiveness
2. **Major releases**: Evaluate if principles need updating based on learnings
3. **New domains**: Ensure domain additions align with existing principles
4. **Performance issues**: Check if principles are creating unacceptable bottlenecks

### Principle Evolution Criteria
Changes to core principles require:
1. **Evidence**: Clear data that current principles cause problems
2. **Consensus**: Agreement from core development team
3. **Impact Analysis**: Understanding of what changes throughout the system
4. **Migration Plan**: How to update existing code and documentation
5. **Testing**: Validation with real LLM-agent workflows

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Interface Anti-Patterns
- **Parameter Explosion**: Too many required parameters
- **Technical Jargon**: Using statistical terms instead of semantic ones
- **Rigid Interfaces**: No flexibility for varied expression of same intent
- **Manual Composition**: Requiring users to transform results between tools

### Architecture Anti-Patterns
- **Memory Assumptions**: Designing for unlimited memory
- **Single-Use Optimization**: Optimizing for one use case at expense of others
- **Library Leakage**: Exposing library-specific patterns in our interfaces
- **Domain Silos**: Domains that don't integrate with others

### Result Anti-Patterns
- **Bare Results**: Raw numbers without context or interpretation
- **Dead Ends**: Results that can't inform subsequent analysis
- **Black Boxes**: No insight into how results were derived
- **Technical Dumps**: Results requiring statistical expertise to interpret
