**Title**: [Release] LocalData MCP - Production-ready database integration for AI workflows

**Post Content**:
Hi r/Python! I just released LocalData MCP, a comprehensive database server for the Model Context Protocol ecosystem that I think the community will find interesting.

**What is it?**
LocalData MCP provides secure, intelligent database connectivity for AI applications. Think of it as a universal database adapter with enterprise security and large dataset handling built-in.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-database support**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB + structured files (CSV, JSON, YAML, TOML)
- **Security first**: Path traversal prevention, SQL injection protection, connection limits
- **Smart large data handling**: Auto SQLite conversion for 100MB+ files, query buffering for large results
- **Production ready**: 100+ test cases, thread-safe, memory efficient

**Why I built it:**
The MCP ecosystem was missing a robust database integration solution. Existing options were either too limited, insecure, or couldn't handle real-world data volumes. I wanted something I'd feel confident deploying in production.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install localdata-mcp
```

**Quick example:**
```python
# Connect to any data source
connect_database("prod", "postgresql", "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db")  
connect_database("config", "yaml", "./settings.yaml")

# Query everything the same way
execute_query("prod", "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users")
config = read_text_file("./settings.yaml", "yaml")
```

**Technical highlights:**
- Thread-safe connection management with semaphores
- Parameterized queries throughout to prevent SQL injection
- Intelligent query buffering with automatic cleanup
- Path security restricting access to working directory only
- Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets

### r/MachineLearning Community Post

**Title**: [P] LocalData MCP - Secure database integration for AI applications

**Post Content**:
**Paper/Project**: LocalData MCP - Production-ready database server for Model Context Protocol
**Links**: GitHub: https://github.com/ChrisGVE/localdata-mcp | PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/localdata-mcp/

**TL;DR**: Universal, secure database connectivity for AI applications with intelligent large dataset handling and enterprise security features.

**Background**
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI applications to access external data sources, but database integration has been fragmented and often insecure. Most solutions lack production-ready features like security controls, large dataset handling, or multi-database support.

**Contribution**
LocalData MCP addresses these limitations with:

1. **Universal Database Support**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, plus structured files (CSV, JSON, YAML, TOML)

2. **Security Architecture**: 
   - Path traversal prevention using resolve() + relative_to() validation
   - SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries and quoted identifiers
   - Connection limiting (max 10 concurrent) with thread-safe management
   - Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

3. **Large Dataset Intelligence**:
   - Files >100MB automatically use temporary SQLite storage
   - Queries >100 rows trigger intelligent buffering system
   - Chunk-based retrieval with automatic cleanup (10min expiry)
   - Memory-efficient processing regardless of dataset size

**Technical Implementation**
- Thread-safe architecture using semaphores and locks
- Query buffering with file modification detection for cache invalidation  
- Backward-compatible API design (100% existing tool preservation)
- Comprehensive test suite (100+ cases covering security, performance, edge cases)

**Use Cases**
- Training data access for ML pipelines
- Real-time inference with database lookups
- Multi-source data analysis (combining databases + config files)
- Development to production environment consistency

**Installation**
```bash
pip install localdata-mcp
```

**Example**
```python
# Connect diverse data sources
connect_database("training", "postgresql", "postgresql://localhost/ml_data")
connect_database("features", "csv", "./feature_vectors.csv")
connect_database("config", "yaml", "./model_config.yaml")

# Query for training pipeline
training_data = execute_query("training", "SELECT * FROM experiments WHERE accuracy > 0.95")
```

The project is open source (MIT) and actively seeking community contributions. Feedback and suggestions welcome!

### r/LocalLLaMA Community Post

**Title**: LocalData MCP - Secure database access for your local AI workflows

**Post Content**:
Hey r/LocalLLaMA! For those running local AI workflows and dealing with database/file integration, I just released something that might be useful.

**What's LocalData MCP?**
A database server designed specifically for AI applications that need to access local data securely. Built for the Model Context Protocol ecosystem but useful for any local AI setup.

**Why this matters for local AI:**
- **Security**: Your local databases/files stay local, with path restrictions preventing AI from accessing system files
- **Performance**: Intelligent handling of large datasets without memory bloat
- **Flexibility**: Connect to PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, plus CSV/JSON/YAML files all through the same interface

**Perfect for local setups because:**
1. **No external dependencies** - everything runs locally
2. **Resource conscious** - smart memory management and connection limits
3. **File security** - restricts access to your working directory only
4. **Mixed data sources** - combine databases with config files seamlessly

**Quick start:**
```bash
pip install localdata-mcp
```

Add to your MCP config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "localdata": {
      "command": "localdata-mcp",
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Example use case:**
```python
# Your local setup
connect_database("documents", "sqlite", "./personal.db")
connect_database("notes", "json", "./obsidian_export.json") 
connect_database("configs", "yaml", "./ai_settings.yaml")

# AI can now query your local data safely
personal_info = execute_query("documents", "SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE category = 'work'")
```

**Security features** (important for local deployments):
- Path traversal prevention (can't access ../../../etc/passwd)
- SQL injection protection throughout
- Connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Input validation on all queries

MIT licensed, contributions welcome!

Anyone else working on local AI data integration? Would love to hear your experiences and use cases.
